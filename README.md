# hackerrank-solutions
This is my HackerRank problem solutions written in Java language!<br>
The goal of this repository is to share my solutions and grow my algorithm solving skills by solving different HackerRank problems.<br>
Check my profile, and let's follow to each other: https://www.hackerrank.com/abzalsahitov<br><br>
All sections will be separated by packages, and each section will be divided by difficulty of these problems.<br>
I will provide an URL to a problem above the class signature, and i will write some sample input and output above the main method of each class.<br>
All solutions will be in separated classes, and all that classes will be commited to master branch, each commit will contain only one class with one solution.<br>
<h1>Have a nice coding!</h1>
